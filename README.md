# üöÄ eChat (Chat and Storage)

### *(Email-Based Application ‚Äî Like WhatsApp is Phone Number-Based)*

A full-stack chat and file storage application built using **Next.js** and **Express (for sockets)**. It combines the power of messaging and file management into one seamless tool.

---

## üéØ Purpose Behind Building This

```bash
We always use WhatsApp or similar chat applications for both personal and professional work.
During that, professionally received files often get mixed up with unnecessary images and documents.

That's why I came up with this idea ‚Äî to merge chat and file storage into one application so that:

1. It can be used professionally.
2. All professional conversations and thoughts are kept in one place.
3. All professional files stay organized in one location.
4. Files can be managed easily with folder creation, deletion, renaming, and other operations.

## üë• Target Audience

```bash
‚Ä¢ Remote Workers
‚Ä¢ Software Developers (SDEs)
‚Ä¢ School Staff
‚Ä¢ Corporate Employees
‚Ä¢ Freelancers
‚Ä¢ Lawyers
‚Ä¢ Anyone who needs to separate work from personal clutter
```

---

## üÜö Why This Competes with Similar Applications

```bash
The reason is:

‚Ä¢ A clean and simple UI
‚Ä¢ Familiar experience like other chat apps
‚Ä¢ File Manager features
‚Ä¢ Extremely accessible

With an intuitive interface, it can stand strong among existing chat and file-sharing apps.

## üß≠ Development Journey

[Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/design/kwJA70CWswiRDP4yCWVBXu/echat?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=YUC3nB5TUUeyq0jZ-0)

```bash
1. Started from my existing backend login/signup template on GitHub.

2. Extended authentication to return the user ID and additional session details.

3. Began production setup to fix build-specific errors.

4. Faced a major Mongoose error in the auth.ts file ‚Äî it took around 2 days to resolve.

https://medium.com/@aniruddh622003/setting-up-mongodb-with-mongoose-and-nextjs-13-3a598609c5d1

Fix found here:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78407469/the-error-was-caused-by-importing-mongoose-dist-browser-umd-js-in-src-model

5. Applied necessary production changes from my backend template‚Äôs README.

6. Initialized socket inside a client component in root layout ‚Äî made it globally accessible by storing it in state.

7. Designed database schema for chat functionality.

8. Implemented schema using Mongoose models.

9. Created server actions and API routes for:
   - Creating connections
   - Group creation
   - Sending messages
   - Deleting messages

10. Used Supabase storage bucket for media management.

11. Implemented file upload to Supabase.

12. Updated database to store file metadata and support folder management.

13. Core features for uploading, managing, and sending files were completed.

14. Started frontend and connected all backend functionalities.

15. Initial version was working but had bugs and performance issues.

16. Decided to restructure DB and APIs to boost performance.

17. Read articles, blogs, and best practices to improve architecture.

18. Studied chat app standards to make this app scalable and production-ready.

19. Rebuilt everything with optimized APIs, data fetching strategies, and rendering logic.

20. Project completed. Looking forward to building more complex and impactful applications to grow my skills!
